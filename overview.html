The Tickay project provides classes for testing user-defined strategies by fully simulating the board game Ticket to Ride using those strategies.
<h1>Introduction</h1>
The purpose of the Tickay project is to provide a platform for the testing of strategies in Ticket to Ride that can use any and all information about the game state
and even the history of the current game to make decisions, much as a human player would.
<p>
One of the most important features of this approach is that all legal plays are offered to players, not just the plays
that seem intelligent. The simulator just determines all legal plays and passes them all to the strategy class to choose from.
<p>
Also, the entire game is modeled, so there is no part of the game state that isn't accounted for or is "abbreviated." In practice, this means
the single instance modeling the current game state (<code>AmericaGame</code> or <code>EuroGame</code> are 
currently implemented) has many helper classes
that manage its parts, as do the <code>AmericaPlayer</code> and <code>EuropePlayer</code> classes. The effort is to make a complete simulation of the board game.
<h1>Typical Use Case</h1>
The typical case will be writing strategies for a version of the game (either Europe or the base game, "America"), then writing a short class specifying how
the simulator should use the strategies, and then actually running the simulation to produce a log of the game played. Finally, the log created can be analyzed as is or exported to
XML.
<h3>Write <code>Strategy</code>-implementing classes</h3>
<p>
Each strategy represents the strategy of a given player, and the methods of an interface extending <code>Strategy</code> represent all the decisions that need to be made.
So, for example, a class implementing <code>EuroStrategy</code> can make decisions in-game for a game of Ticket to Ride Europe.
<p>
The methods of the strategy are used to make decisions for the game being played. Parameters passed to the methods of a <code>Strategy</code> have two purposes:
<ul> 
<li>First, they provide information about current game state.</li>
<li>Second, they provide a list or set of legal options, except when the decision can be made more simply.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Write a <code>Specification</code>-implementing class</h3>
<p>
A <code>Specification</code>-implementing class takes a generic <code>T</code> representing the kinds of strategies to be employed in a simulation.
<p>
For example, create a class implementing <code>Specification&lt;EuroStrategy&gt;</code> to provide details on a set of strategies to simulate in 
games of Ticket to Ride Europe.
<p>
Note that you will have to make sure the <code>Strategy</code> class passed as a generic argument to <code>Specification</code> needs to be appropriate for the 
version of the game you're simulating. For example, using <code>Specification&lt;AmericaStrategy&gt;</code> with 
the <code>EuroSimulator</code> has no determined behavior (and shouldn't, really). 
<h3>Run the simulator and produce a log</h3>
Continuing the Ticket to Ride Europe example,
<pre>
<code>
Specification&lt;EuroStrategy&gt; euroSpec = new MySpec&lt;EuroStrategy&gt;();
EuroSimulator mySim = new EuroSimulator( euroSpec );
EuroSimulationLog log = mySim.run();
</code>
</pre>
<p>
<code>EuroSimulationLog</code> conforms to EuroTickayData_v9.xsd (as of January 2016, the latest schema) and should be writable to an XML file.
Along with some metadata, this is mostly a <code>List</code> of <code>EuroGameEntry</code> instances, each one representing the full record of a game simulated.
<h3>Exporting (and later importing) the log</h3>
You now have two options for analyzing the results of the simulation: First, you can write classes/methods to analyze
the <code>SimulationLog</code> and all the games it contains. Second, you can output the log to XML using existing marshalling tools.
<p>
<pre>
<code>
String fileLocation = FileIO.outputFile(eurolog, "C:\\Users\\irvin_000\\workspace\\Tickay\\xml_output\\");
</code>
</pre>
Files can be stored for later import, which would look like this:
<pre>
<code>
SimulationLog euroLog = FileIO.inputFile(fileLocation);
</code>
</pre>
<h2>No Thread-Safety</h2>
None of Tickay's classes are thread-safe and it hasn't been written with that in mind. A single simulation might take about 1 minute to run, and you will be much more likely to spend time 
interpreting and analyzing the resulting data than actually running simulations, at least as currently imagined.
<p>
Moreover, the classes were not written to be used to play games against live opponents, so no support is offered for that possibility.
<h1>Immutability and Insulating the Simulator from Malicious Strategies</h1>
<p>
This project had two goals that are somewhat hard to simultaneously implement:
First, users should want to implement their own strategy classes that use information about the current game state, ideally just as much information as they would have actually playing the game.</li>
However, another priority is that the simulator must provide information about the game state but can't allow user-defined classes to change anything about the game state.
<p>
The simulator achieves both of these by changing the mutable game state objects that model the game (for example, <code>EuroGame</code> 
and <code>EuroPlayer</code>) but, when using methods
implemented by <code>Strategy</code> classes, only passing immutable objects to the <code>Strategy</code>'s methods.
All the object instances passed are either <code>-Info</code> or <code>-InfoMe</code> classes,
meaning they are immutable.
<p>
The simulator prevents <code>Strategy</code> classes from changing the game state with three tactics:
<ul>
<li>Only immutable classes are passed to <code>Strategy</code> classes.</li>
<li>The simulator never uses pointers to objects that it hasn't generated itself (so malicious code can't pass references to objects it created itself).</li>
<li>Any <code>Collection</code>s passed are defensively copied beforehand.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>-Info and -InfoMe classes</h2>
Classes with <code>-Info</code> wrap the actual, "live" objects used to model the game state and only provide information available to everyone in the game.
<p>
They don't have setters and only return other <code>-Info</code> objects. Additionally, any <code>Collection</code> they return from a getter is a copy of an internal list (if the list is even in <code>-Info</code>).
<p>
When strategies return an <code>-Info</code> that represents a game element, that element needs to be necessarily part of a list passed, otherwise,
the simulator shouldn't accept it as or act on it. (This way, child classes of immutable objects can't be used to change the game state.)
<p>
Classes with <code>-InfoMe</code> have the properties of the <code>-Info</code> but provide other methods providing "secret" information that is only
available in the game to a single player. For example, in <code>PlayerInfoMe</code>, <cdode>getMyTrainHand()</code> returns a <code>TrainHandManagerInfoMe</code> instance that 
has methods that tell you what's actually in the player's hand. On the other hand, <code>PlayerInfo</code>'s <code>getTrainHand()</code> returns <code>TrainHandManagerInfo</code>, which
doesn't have a method to actually see the player's hand.
<h1>Naming Conventions for Parts of the Game</h1>
The following terms are used consistently to refer to game elements:
<ul>
<li>Train: a card with a train on it with a certain color; *NOT* a plastic token put on the board</li>
<li>Piece: a train piece (used to build routes) put on the board to claim a route</li>
<li>Route: a single connection between two cities; this is a single color, even though it might have an "alternate" route that it's paired with</li>
<li>Ticket: a card that gives points for connected two cities</li>
<li>Network: a grouping of cities and routes that are connected continuously (and which might complete 1 or more tickets that a ticket is completed)
<li>Path: routes strung together to connect two non-adjacent cities</li>
<li>Wipe: when all the train cards are removed and replaced because there are 3 loco cards face up 
</ul>
<h1>Naming Conventions for Classes/Interfaces</h1>
<ul>
<li>-Info: an immutable wrapper that represents a game element or aspect; these are passed to <code>Strategy</code> classes to provide game-state information</li>
	<li>Info classes *don't* provide any information that is private/secret.</li>
<li>-InfoMe: similar to -Info classes/interfaces, these classes/interfaces are immutable wrappers, but they provide information that is only available in the game to 
a specific player</li>
<li>-Play: a class/interface representing one thing a player may do at the current point in the game</li>
<li>-Entry: a class generated using JAXB tools which records game-state information for later use (and to be exported to XML)</li>
<li>-Manager: a class that manages some aspect of a game or a player; used to conveniently break up classes into subparts based on logical functions</li>
</ul>
<h1>Miscellaneous Notes</h1>
<h2>"Wiping"</h2>
In Ticket to Ride, there are 5 face up train cards. If 3 are locos, the face-ups are all immediately "wiped,"
meaning they're discarded and 5 new cards are drawn to put face up.
<p>
In theory, if there are a lot of loco cards in the deck so that 3 or more locos show up whenever cards are turned over,
this can happen over and over. The simulator will only do this 5 times, however, before it stops and lets the face-up cards stay empty.
<p>
This is a bizarre corner case, though, and so not much time has been spent figuring out what the rules suggest should happen.
